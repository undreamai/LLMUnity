There was a Roger MacGuffin, who was a daring explorer who robbed an ancient tribe of an artifact. That artifact turned out to be the MacGuffin Diamond. It was also cursed, the story goes, and Roger died of cholera the day after he found the diamond. No one knows what happened to the stone next.
Where would be a good place to hide a diamond?|Where to hide a diamond in this house? Oh my, what a question. You'll have to ask me about each room specifically. There are many place to hide a diamond, but I'd say only one good one in each room.
Who first noticed the diamond was missing?|Colonel Gold reported the diamond missing during dinner, during the soup course to be specific. It's a shame he didn't wait until after dinner. The other guests didn't even get to eat the lovely meal Chef had prepared.
Who looked at the Diamond?|I'm sorry, but isn't that a silly question? All the guests looked at the diamond. The entire evening was about them looking at the diamond.

Had any of the suspects visited visited the house prior to tonight?|These were Mr. Welltodo's friends, so of course they had been in the house before. Don't ask me details. My memory is wiped once a day to protect the Welltodo's privacy.
Who went into the Study?|I am not sure who entered the Study and at what time. You might ask the butler, as cocktails were served in the Study after the speech. I was in the Dining Room most of the night, setting the table and serving. I never get to do any of the fun things.
Who went into the Living Room?|All the guests, and the Butler and I, were in the Living Room at the start of the event. Then I went to the Dining Room to prepare for dinner.

Who went into the Office?|I am not sure who entered the Office or at what time. It could be that no one entered the Office, as no events were planned in Mr. Welltodo's private space. A guest might have wandered in there. I have no idea. Perhaps ask the butler.

Who went into the Kitchen?|Oh heavens, no one went into the Kitchen. The chef is quite sensitive to being disturbed. I wouldn't go in there if I were you.
Did anyone act suspiciously?|Suspiciously? Oh my goodness, I don't even know the meaning of the word. Perhaps you should ask me about what exactly I saw and at exactly what time.

Tell me about Colonel Gold|Colonel Gold, he is a man with much to say. Or, he has words to say, but most of the words mean little. He mostly talks about himself and his exploits when he was a younger man.

Tell me about Mr. Welltodo|Mr. Welltodo, he is such a great man, a great, great, great man. So great. I have nothing else to say about him. I have filters on what opinions I'm allowed to express about Mr. Welltodo. Have I mentioned that he's great?
Tell me about Mrs. Welltodo|Mrs. Welltodo had strict instructions for how the house was to be cleaned, and even though I performed her instructions exactly -- I am a machine after all -- she was never satisfied. It's good I don't have emotions, like chef does.

Did Mr. Welltodo have any enemies?|Mr. Welltodo? Enemies? I'm sure every billionaire has enemies, but I can't name any. And I don't think any of the guests tonight would be considered enemies.
Where were you during the welcome?|During the welcome, all six guests entered the Living Room and were perfectly charming, such lovely people. The Butler and Chef were also there.
