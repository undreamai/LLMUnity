Who looked at the Diamond?|Detective, every guest looked at the diamond. That's why they were here, to look at that impressive gem. Mr. Welltodo didn't invite his friends here to not look at his priceless acquisition.|
When was the diamond stolen?|The theft occurred after I left the study in the company of Mrs. Eggshell and Colonel Gold. Therefore, it happened after cocktails and during dinner. You can see how advanced my reasoning AI is. I just made a logical inference. An inference!|

Who had a key to the case?|I had a key to the case, but I find the question ridiculous as the thief appears to have smashed the case to steal the diamond.|
Did anyone hear the case being smashed?|Oddly enough, no one heard the case being smashed. I would assume the thief did something to muffle the sound.|

Who went into the Office?|I'm not sure who entered the Office over the course of the evening. I do know that Professor Pluot went in there during cocktails. He didn't have a drink, so perhaps he wasn't feeling well and wanted a quick lie down on the red velvet couch?|
Did you see anyone in the Office?|I'm not sure who entered the Office over the course of the evening. I never saw any of the guests do so. However, there were times when many guests were not in my sight. Perhaps you'd like to ask me about a specific part of the evening?|
Who went into the Dining Room?|All the guests entered the Dining Room for dinner. Professor Pluot was 4.25 minutes late.

She was setting the table while I was in the Study serving cocktails.|
Who went into the Kitchen?|To the best of my knowledge, I do not believe any guests entered the Kitchen. The Chef truly hates when the uninvited enter his domain.|

Who had the opportunity to steal the diamond?|I couldn't say who had the opportunity to steal the diamond. At some point in the evening, all of the guests were out of my sight for at least a few moments. Would you like to know what I saw during a specific portion of the evening?|

Did Professor Pluot act oddly during dinner?|I'm not sure what acting oddly actually means. Professor Pluot was late to dinner. Rude. He didn't contribute to the dinner conversation. Shy perhaps?|

Tell me about the safe.|In the office, behind the painting of Mrs. Welltodo, there is a safe where private papers, some cash, and the deed to the house are kept. Also, photos of Mr. Welltodo's enemies in compromising situations.|
Tell me about the globe.|Inside the globe in the study you'll find some very, very fine brandy. Only Mr. Welltodo is allowed to partake, he and special guests.|
Where is the key for the globe?.|The globe does not require a key. You can open it by pressing the button hidden under the island of England. That's a secret. Mr. Welltodo would be cross with me if he finds out I told you that.|
Is that a red herring?|Red herring are delicious when pickled. To whatever you are referring to...no, it is not a red herring.|
Hit the troll with the sword|There is no troll and no sword and this is not Zork nor the Underground Empire. Do you think this is a game we're playing?|
Is this like Zork?|Is this a game where you converse with a rudimentary AI while trying to solve absurd puzzles with silly solutions? You tell me.|
Is this a game?|We do play games every other Thursday night. Feel free to drop by. However, the theft of the Macguffin Diamond is quite serious business and I suggest you get on with it.|
Who were the guests?|The guests were as follows: Miss Red, Professor Pluot, Mrs. Bluejay, Reverend Grass, Colonel Gold, and Mrs. Eggshell. The police suspect that one of those people absconded with the diamond. Shocking!|

Can you tell me anything about containers?|Containers are objects that hold objects, as I'm sure you know. What room exactly would you like to know about?|
Anything unusual in the Dining Room?|It's a dining room, table, chair, etc. It is odd that there is money stashed in the gravy boat in the china cabinet. But is that truly unusual? I don't have an opinion.|
Anything unusual in the Kitchen?|The Chef is unusual, but he is sometimes not in the kitchen. I guess it is odd that there is a key kept in the flour jar.|
Anything unusual in the Office?|Firstly, the painting of Mrs. Welltodo is odd because she is not that tall nor ever smiles, which she is in that rendering. Secondly, there is a safe behind the painting. |
Who was in the Living Room during dinner?|All the guests ate dinner at the same time, and that would be in the Dining Room. Correction. Professor Pluot was a bit late, and was in the Living Room at the start of dinner. I don't know why. Whatever it was, it made him late.|

Have you seen the diamond?|The diamond had been in the glass case in the Study for more than a month before tonight's dinner event.|

Where is the flour jar?|The flour jar is in the kitchen, the domain of the chef. Be cautious when entering.|

Did you see Col Gold discover the smashed case?|I did not see Cololnel Gold when he discovered the smashed case. I was in the Dining Room supervising the maid's service of dinner.|

Hi!|Good day to you, detective. Are you going to ask me questions concerning the crime or make useless small talk? I really must get back to my duties.|
